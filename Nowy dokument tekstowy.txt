1. Is it up to me how I handle methods in DAO like insert/delete/update i.e. Delete by ID or Update specific atribute ?
2. In the WebServiceTester - I'm recieving errors. I'm not sure if the urlParameters should be included in the method or shall the function recieve them from restService in browser? I.e if I post to http://localhost:8000/insert this ?StudentNumber=1234&Email=email@email.com in rest shall it be picked up by function in WebServiceTester and display the result in console and add it to the DB?
3.WebServiceTester - postStudent() if this handles StudentNumber=1234&Email=email@email.com like in examples on moodle and make use of insertHandler() which is setup for JSON handling. How it suppose to work. I mean shall i configure InsertHandler to handle JSON and above format?
